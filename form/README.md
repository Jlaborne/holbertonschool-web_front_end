# Web Forms Project

This project focuses on creating accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing web forms using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The goal is to master the basics of form usability, accessibility, and validation while adhering to modern web standards.

## Project Overview

The project includes:

- A **comment section** form with structured inputs, labels, placeholders, and validation.
- A **search form** integrated into the navigation bar.
- Error handling and validation using pure HTML/CSS.
- Fully responsive design with a focus on accessibility and usability.

## Features

### Comment Form

- Collects personal information (First Name, Last Name, Email).
- Includes a section for submitting comments with a title and comment text.
- Validation for each input:
  - **First Name and Last Name**: At least 3 characters, only letters and spaces.
  - **Email**: Must follow a valid email pattern.
  - **Comment**: At least 10 characters.

### Search Form

- Integrated into the navigation bar for seamless access.
- Expands on focus for user input.
- Includes an accessible SVG search icon.

### Accessibility

- All inputs have descriptive labels and ARIA attributes for better accessibility.
- Uses proper semantic HTML elements, such as `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`.

### Validation

- Validation is handled using HTML5 attributes and regular expressions.
- Error and success states are displayed with visual cues (icons and border colors).

## File Structure

### HTML Files

Each step of the project is captured in a separate HTML file:

- `00-article.html`: Basic structure and content of the article.
- `01-article.html`: Added a comment section.
- `02-article.html`: Enhanced structure with fieldsets.
- `03-article.html`: Labels and containers for inputs.
- `04-article.html`: Added input elements with constraints.
- `05-article.html`: Added helper messages for inputs.
- `06-article.html`: Added pure HTML/CSS error handling.
- `07-article.html`: Final version with a search form.

### CSS Files

Each step also has a corresponding CSS file:

- `00-styles.css` through `07-styles.css`: Gradual enhancement of styles for the forms and layout.

## Key Concepts Learned

1. **HTML5 Form Elements**

   - Understanding `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`, and `<input>`.
   - Using the appropriate input types like `text`, `email`, and `textarea`.

2. **CSS for Forms**

   - Styling form inputs for hover, focus, valid, and invalid states.
   - Adding helper text and icons for error/success feedback.

3. **Regular Expressions**

   - Applying patterns to validate input fields directly in HTML.

4. **Accessibility**

   - Using `aria-label` and descriptive placeholders.
   - Ensuring forms are usable for keyboard navigation.

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Adapting the layout for different screen sizes.
